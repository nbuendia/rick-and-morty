## Introduction

I'd like to give a shout out to the creators of The Rick & Morty API, they truly inspired me to create this project and I wouldnt be able to do this without them! If you're a fan of the show, I encourage you to look thorugh their API and support!

## Description

This site displays one random character in the show a day, everyday. Characters shouldn't change on page refresh or browser closure. If you don't like the character that was chosen, you can click on the 'Randomize' button and it'll choose another character at random for you.
